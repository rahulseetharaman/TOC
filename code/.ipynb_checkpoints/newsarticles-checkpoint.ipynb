work in terms of your own style do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done do you build on the ideas of others or are you a more introspective problem solver in order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like minded people may assist it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water and weather tight and the structure is checked for stability it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn this would also allow for a well insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn as for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne barn the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible a wireless router access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area your local it supplier will be able to advise on this if you have already invested in robust firewall and anti virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and

game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead japan is the world least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us by japan population is expected to peak at million then shrink to under million by the middle of the century this means million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled in the year if the birth rate remains the same people over will make up over of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo so how will japan finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about of the country gross domestic product gdp the highest rate among industrialised countries the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from the cost of running japan welfare state will double to more than of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks who going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff standing

becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject but for the japanese economy facing fewer consumers by means slumping domestic sales of cars hi tech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash of course the japanese could always have more children the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia but there would be no pay back until when today babies are taxpayers and the demographic

country ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semi conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency come japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power there are fears that the world

       " 'fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis there is fresh hope the country economy is set to grow about this year after seeing growth last year a sharp turnaround from when output fell the unemployment rate is improving too it is set to slip below by the end of the year down from in may true problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement even the international monetary fund imf admits this the argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy thomas dawson an imf director said earlier this month argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the government decisions pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country massive debts in response angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month argentina was on the brink of collapse the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso decade long peg to the us dollar in february the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people life savings disappear scathes of companies went bust three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine it really was dire but since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentine mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad but now he is using his money to help with the start up a trading company he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are re opening but not all that shines is gold argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of president nestor kirchner administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around it is not proving easy debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate argentina current offer implies that the creditors would get just cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imf managing director rodrigo rato everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring with the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe a lot of them invested in good faith he said the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country legal system on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed if i have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank',\n",

       " 'franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland role in making century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they are self sufficient he said but so called commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i do know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea kapranos and his glasgow four piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week brit awards including best group and best album their self titled debut album won last year mercury music prize and spawned three top singles he told the strong audience at the university reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm he concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i do really care about the brits he said it going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight i think the government should do more to help up and coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels rather than expecting the government i e the taxpayer to fork out why do some of the megastars put something back in some of britain wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds if they can fund football why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it ! franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods ! i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque should be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses there are already thousands of state funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idol type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if they had a government grant to get started they have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they a musician the government should fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies ! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for ! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government would have to fork out a great deal yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol style music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you like though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately funded organizations like save the music in the us',\n",

! ! best song in years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really ! listened to angels on radio this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection ! as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last years that deserve this award more it not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last years ! ! what about the specials ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear us apart angels is middle of the road rubbish angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap it musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result is very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music ! best of the last years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last years after all it alright for a pop song but the best song of the last years there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last years it a travesty rubbish ! who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio but i do recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who would know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last years should not include songs less than years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show you got to be kidding angels is a great song but not the best song of the last years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i do think its the best song from the past years ! right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song is that good ! im happy for robbie himself though ! best song in the last years what a joke ! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins does deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it proof that music and democracy just do mix still at least it was will young oh it all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously ! robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non fans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent ! i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no one to slow dance with ! i agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels is really that good a song it certainly is anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush angels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers it a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late and early for example they were cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think yes angels is the best song since the past years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning i always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting it orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who do particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing it is merely an irritating distraction a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know a dozen songs or so do you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisss angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven year old girl perhaps i mean will young come on what a load of crap best song in the last years i do think so ! ! what about all the real artists out there over the last years the list is endless but robbie williams does even come close what a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radio off why a half baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last years ! ! ! ! i think not i did realize radio had so many listeners under the age of ! ! people have such short memories ! a great song yes but the best of the last years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here the great british public at work again it a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted it not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope no because im not female and im not ! ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past years ! the shortlist was great but him winning it is a joke ! predictable and laughable the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie repertoire never mind best song of the last years i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list have radio listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last years than robbie williams ever will no doubt about it there not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song it should have been joy division those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today yes ! ! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win ! robbie was a deserved winner i am astounded that such a second rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs ! it a terrible song voted for by the masses who do have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music the best song of the past years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose it confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull lt no offence robbie but pleeease ! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin ! i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he does deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust ! ! obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it if this is the best song of the last years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record a sad day for music it not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people that why it has been voted best song of the last years it a good all rounder just like robbie best song in years since im confused angels is a bad song it a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything it regressive bland even i suppose it just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become granted angels is a good song however it really was up against any other proper competition the queen song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic ! also why were the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie was getting more awards so they had to make one up for him ! best song of the last years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it was bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful angels is without doubt a great song but i really do think it deserves the title of best song in years perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song ! ! ! do get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners it would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past years ! im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular i nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit no surprise really it voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard ! it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come it an absolute joke however most of the original were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it did end up in the hands of will young though although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that all it means !',\n",

       " 'brits debate over urban music joss stone a year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is im not really comfortable with the word urban it a word that been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it wrong how far are the brits removed from inner city music and what people are doing it so far removed that i do expect them to get it bang on the music industry is championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people do feel like that anything to do with us i do feel like urban music just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that there an urban music scene because it all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day it not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she signed to then so be it it got nothing to do with what really going on urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that she a uk artist what has really captured everybody imagination is that here you have a year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good i think that what done it the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base i do think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that she from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she literally rural the great thing about urban music is that there a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think that where you can call it urban that where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you could argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real that the only cut off point we have here and that the only way by which we judge people what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race does make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award a type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life she might not be urban but when did r b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now r b stands for rhythm and blues remember ! that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stone albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who were nominated or did win i cant see why people ca just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strange what in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term ance music is misleading because it does describe everything you can dance to whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i been to good luck to joss stone let celebrate her victory let also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast we did see a single black artist on stage collecting an award so what you saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who is black and if it is then they should be acknowledged for it even if they pretty dam good at it she has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but she not black well let make her feel real bad about it then how dare she ! though hang on did the so called public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the and in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth it a lazy term to categorise music that you do really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents i demand a prize for rural music ! sucks to the cities it way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense i love joss to bits and do care what her branding is it amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and let just call it music and let especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with crunk urban is just a word that come about recently to describe black music that become popular now the word was even in use or common use five of six years ago it just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it im in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label i hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because that all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc who ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos but why not brits so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stone talent but why did jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people ! you have said it there is music you like and music you do like who cares what label you put on it that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i do think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well does that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london manchester etc and does that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it does make any sense why does music have to be put into a genre it music you like it or you do simple as that i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i do know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they a white rock band they wo be described as such joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though there only two kinds of music good and bad',\n",

in the us replaces the stop motion models of the tv show with polished computer generated animation in a similar fashion the thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the now defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash this cg animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the stop motion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site and the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry anderson thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic children tv shows have a built in audience that make them ideal for reinvention i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but i think it backfiring what next the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global box office performance the film cost but only recouped the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment after the success of garfield the movie britain shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle with only episodes made of the series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ furry recyclers have already had one big screen outing wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed the magic roundabout is out in the uk on february how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money ! thundercats ! ! i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in ! it will bring my youth back ! get your hands off the clangers ! is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana splits ! what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse ! but then again it could be better than the original series could it it always nice to see these old toons re released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song ! i think i been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memories i think remakes are a good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally i like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and m a s k get full hollywood remakes leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a rating part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that ! films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place i have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film it got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two it all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are film makers running out of original ideas all i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever i recently re watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now it just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new it got to be mr benn the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing ! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know ! why ca the british film industry try making gerry anderson ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people in today media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes dj are sampling or re working and music even computer games from years ago are getting modern re workings personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more ! why not just leave our misty eyed nostalgia alone mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i was even there ! i like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today film makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern children book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have loved to see dungeons dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into did come up to scratch the only one that is to be remade as yet is thundercats which i like to see im an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children programs for my daughters my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen ! ! very scandinavian rainbow ! i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod oh the list could go on and on ! ! ! if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price ! i do care ! till then i have to make do with the citreon c advert i luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb children programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch hmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at im showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best children programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliver postgate wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe car of course gerry anderson supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big screen big budget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childre movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves it only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods is it i hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation i love that one in a shed clunkiness and you could recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mock authentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega ! this re gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people ideas because it guarantees to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short term the fact that they will be forgotten in months time is irrelevant e g starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it ! i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only and do remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and it a classic the fact it so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though it so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it',\n",
